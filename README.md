Main components to this project:
1. Realization of the fundamental definition of generalization (karnaugh map simplification)
1. Algorithm for finding sufficiently generalizing covering products. (through unsatisfying coverage reduction) (must be sufficiently fast)
1. Algorithmic speed-up of unsatisfying coverage reduction through an intelligent use of caching. (Assists to speed up process where there are multiple satisfying inputs)
